title: How to use shaders
---

# Setup dev enviroment

## Download unity

You can't load shader directly in-game, you need to compile it first. And for that, you need unity with exactly same version as the one which Streets of Rogue uses.

Go to [Unity download archive](https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive) and download there version 2020.3.23f1

(Unity hub may ask you for license, just select "personal")

## Add builder

Now, create new empty project in unity. Create there folder "Editor", and put there [this file](https://fastdl.raftmodding.com/AssetBundleBuilder.zip).

# Making asset bundle

## Create material

Now, create your shader. You need to know HLSL to write it, and you can try looking at existing shaders.

Then, create `New > Material`, and select your shader as material's shader.

## Create asset bundle

In inspector, below material's properties, there should be two fields with `None` value.
First one can be anything, that's name of asset bundle you'll load in-game. Second one must be `.assets`

After that, right click anywhere in file viewer, and select "Build AssetBundles". If you did `Add builder` step correctly, it should appear.
Just select your bundle, and it'll be builded.

# Using bundle in mod

## Add bundle as resource

After your bundle was builded, it should appear in `Assets/AssetBundles`.
You can drag it from unity to file explorer. Put it somewhere in your mod, and add that resource, just like any sprite you add.

## Using shader in-game

To use your shader, you need to load it.

```csharp
private Material? material;

public IEnumerator Start()
{
    AssetBundleCreateRequest req = AssetBundle.LoadFromMemoryAsync(Properties.Resources.CrispyBundle);
    yield return req;
    material = req.assetBundle.LoadAsset<Material>("<Name of your material>");
}
```

Then use that material somehow.

# Examples


```csharp
[BepInEx.BepInPlugin(@"abbysssal.streetsofrogue.crispymod", "S&S: Crispy Mod", "1.0.0")]
public class CrispyPlugin : BepInEx.BaseUnityPlugin
{
    public void Awake()
    {
        Harmony harmony = new Harmony(Info.Metadata.GUID);
        harmony.Patch(AccessTools.Method(typeof(CameraScript), nameof(CameraScript.RealStart)), null,
                  new HarmonyMethod(AccessTools.Method(typeof(CrispyPlugin), nameof(AttachCrispyScript))));
    }
    public static void AttachCrispyScript(CameraScript __instance)
    {
        GameObject go = __instance.GetComponentInChildren<Camera>().gameObject;
        _ = go.GetComponent<CrispyScript>() ?? go.AddComponent<CrispyScript>();
    }
}

public class CrispyScript : MonoBehaviour
{
    private float brightness = 1.5f;
    private float saturation = 2f;
    private float contrast = 2f;
    private Material? material;

    public IEnumerator Start()
    {
        AssetBundleCreateRequest req = AssetBundle.LoadFromMemoryAsync(Properties.Resources.CrispyBundle);
        yield return req;
        material = req.assetBundle.LoadAsset<Material>("CrispyMaterial");
    }
    public void Update()
    {
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Insert)) brightness += 0.1f;
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Delete)) brightness -= 0.1f;
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Home)) saturation += 0.1f;
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.End)) saturation -= 0.1f;
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.PageUp)) contrast += 0.1f;
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.PageDown)) contrast -= 0.1f;
    }
    public void OnRenderImage(RenderTexture src, RenderTexture dest)
    {
        if (material is not null && material)
        {
            material.SetFloat("_Brightness", brightness);
            material.SetFloat("_Saturation", saturation);
            material.SetFloat("_Contrast", contrast);
            Graphics.Blit(src, dest, material);
        }
        else Graphics.Blit(src, dest);
    }
}
```
